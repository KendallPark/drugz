      Block:
      - '2'
      Case:
      - C3
      Drug: Piperacillin
      Class: Beta Lactamase Inhibitors
      Mechanism: Beta lactam antibiotic used for pseudomonal infections. It is commonly
        combined with beta lactamase inhibitor and administered as piperacillin tazobactam
        combo. Cannot be fiven orally and therefore is always given IV or IM. Unlike
        penicillins, these drugs have activity against gram negative organisms like
        pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis.
      Therapeutic Use: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis.

      Mechanism: Irreversibly bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria to inhibit
        formation of initation complex and interfere with the mRNA proofreading complex.
        Also inhibit translocation of peptidyl tRNA and disrupt bacterial cell membranes.

        and Enterobacter. Septicemia, complicated intrabdominal infections, UTIs,
        and nosocomial URIs. Not given orally, due to poor absorption from the small
        intestine. Can also be used as an opthalmic soluction for bacterial conjunctivitis.
      Adverse Effects: SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN ORALLY. Nephrotoxicity when used with cephalosporins,
        Ototoxcitiy when used with loop diuretics. Also a teratogen.

        resistance --> decreased preload and afterload --> increased cardiac output
        --> reduces aortal and LV stress and decreased BP
      Therapeutic Use: hypertensive crises; aortic dissection; acute decompensated
        heart failure
      Misc.: black box warning for thiocyanate toxicity; not used long-term for that

        as metabolites can acculumate in the kidneys causing toxicity. Should not
        be taken with MAO inhibitiors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or
        tricyclic antidepressants, due to increased risk of serotonin syndrome, coma,
        and death

      Drug: Fentanyl
      Class: Opoid Analgesic
      Mechanism: "Binds many opioid receptors in the \n CNS --> hyperpolarization
        and decreased activity of neural cells; increases pain threshold, inhibits
        ascending pain pathways, alters pain reception"
      Therapeutic Use: Pain Control; General anesthesia (adjunctive)
      Adverse Effects: |-

      Block:
      - '4'
      Case:
      - C2
      Drug: Neostigmine
      Class: Anticholinesterase
      Mechanism: Reversibly binds to andcompetively inhibits acetylcholinesterase
        --> increased ACh available at the NMJ to bind to AChRs. Also a weak agonist
        to nicotinic receptors (direct agonist). Does not cross BBB.
      Therapeutic Use: Myasthenia gravis; post-op bladder distention/urinary retention;
        reversal of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants

        Bradycardia, hypotension
      Misc.: Per LexiComp and our own pharmacist (Sarju), shorter half-life than Pyridostigmine.
        (Shorter half-life typically equates to more severe effects than longer half-life)

      Class: corticosteroid
      Mechanism: metabolized in the liver to prednisolone --> binds to glucocorticoid
        receptor --> translocates to nucleus --> effects directly on DNA transcription
        --> up-regulation of anti-inflammatory proteins --> suppresses inflammation
        and immune system
      Therapeutic Use: allergies, asthma, anti-inflammatory (IBDs), immunosuppression
      Adverse Effects: weight gain, fluid retention, increased BP

      Block:
      - '4'
      Case:
      - C4
      Drug: Naproxen
      Class: NSAID
      Mechanism: Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 --> inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins;
        May inhibit chemotaxis, alter lymphocyte activity, decrease proinflammatory
        cytokine activity, and inhibit neutrophil aggregation
      Therapeutic Use: Mild to moderate pain, RA, OA, tendonitis, bursitis, acute
        gout, migraine, amenorrhea
      Adverse Effects: Constipation, dizziness, headache, nausea, GI bleeding
      Misc.: less likely than other NSAIDs to have adverse effects of MI, stroke,
        GI irritation and inflammation. Preferred medication to be used in pt's with
        high risk of such complications
    ASA:
      Block:
      - '4'
      Case:
      - C4
      Drug: ASA
      Class: Analgesic
      Mechanism: Acts on hypothalamus to produce antipyresis; prostaglandin synthetase
        inhibition --> decreased formation of thromboxane A2 --> anti-inflammatory.
        IRREVERSIBLY covalently modifies COX1 and COX2. Does not bind.
      Therapeutic Use: |-
        Pain, fever, inflammation
        Taken to prevent heart attacks, strokes and chest pain
      Adverse Effects: "Tinnitus, dyspepsia, Reye's \n syndrome"
      Misc.: Actions are dose-dependent
    Codeine:
      Block:
      - '4'
      Case:
      - C4
      Drug: Codeine
    Fluoxetine:
      Block:
      - '4'
      Case:
      - C4
      Drug: Fluoxetine
      Class: Antidepressant
      Mechanism: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; little or no affinity for
        alpha-adrenergic histamine or cholinergic receptor
      Therapeutic Use: 'Antidepressant, Antianxiety, '
      Adverse Effects: 'nausea and headaches (esp when first starting), sexual dysfunction
        is very common in this class (KNOW THIS), sleep disturbances. Serious side
        effect: Serotonin Syndrome'

      Block:
      - '4'
      Case:
      - C4
      Drug: Ibuprofen
      Class: NSAID
      Mechanism: REVERSIBLY inhibits Cox1 and 2 (Cox 1 inhibitied more than Cox 2);
        so platelets can regenerate thromboxane A 2 levels (does not inhibit platelet
        aggregation). Aspirin hits the enzymes irreversibly so platelets cant regenerate
        thromboxane till new platelets are made (8-10 days)
      Therapeutic Use: |-
        Pain reliever
         Fever reducer

      Class: Thiazide diuretic
      Mechanism: Inhibits urine production by blocking the reabsorption of NaCl in

      Therapeutic Use: Hypertension, edema (can be used in moderate heart failure
        patients to decrease excess fluid in the system)
